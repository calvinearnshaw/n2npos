# n2npos

N2NPOS, or "end-to-end point-of-sale" is a POS system designed for Windows 10.
This application uses SQL server as a backend database to store the data held in the system.
This is also my first application written in C#.

Currently, this application is unavailable for release. Likewise, this application will not function as intended until the final release in early 2019.
